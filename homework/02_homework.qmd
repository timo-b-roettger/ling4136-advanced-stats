# Preamble: Loading packages and configuration

```{r}
#| label: data_and_libraries
#| echo: false

# just run this code chunk
# function to ignoring the setting of the relative path below when knitting
run_if_not_knitting <- function(expr) {
  if (!isTRUE(getOption("knitr.in.progress"))) {
    eval(expr)
  }
}

# nifty code using the pacman package
# it checks if the packages specified below are installed, if not, they will be installed, if yes, they will be loaded
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(rstudioapi, tidyverse, lme4, ggeffects)

# set the current working directory to the one where this file is
run_if_not_knitting(current_working_dir <- dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))

# Exercise 1

### Introduction to data

We will be working with Quantese again, see `01_exercise.qmd` and the other data resources for a refresher.

```{r}
#| label: load-quantese

quantese <- read_csv("../../data/quantese_naming_sim.csv") 

# add log-transformed reaction time
quantese <- quantese |> 
  mutate(log_rt = log(rt))

# have a look
quantese

```

### (A) check the design and formualte a linear mixed effects model

Imagine, the researchers wanted to test the following hypotheses:

*"We hypothesize that log-transformed reaction times are affected by lexical frequency"*

Run an appropriate linear mixed effects model to test this hypothesis. If you run into convergence issues, deal with them as you see fit.

```{r}
#| label: lmer_quantese

# YOUR CODE HERE

```

### (B) interpret the model output

Take your selected model, interpret the model coefficients and calculate p-values for the relevant predictor.

```{r}
#| label: lmer_quantese

# YOUR CODE HERE
# YOUR ANSWER HERE

```

### (C) Optional: plot predictions

Plot the model predictions alongside a measure of uncertainty (standard error or 95% CI). If you can, plot the model predictions on top of the raw data.

Estimating variance components for linear mixed effects models is mathematically not as straightforward as it is for simple linear models. We skip manual extraction for now and use the beautiful `ggeffects` package. Check their `predict_response()` function and use it to derive predictions and plot them.

```{r}
#| label: plot_prediction_quantese

# YOUR CODE HERE

```

### (D) write up results

Write up your analysis and results accordingly.
